The Watershed Boundary Dataset (WBD) defines the areal extent of surface water drainage to a point, accounting for all land and surface areas. Watershed Boundaries are determined solely upon science-based hydrologic principles, not favoring any administrative boundaries or special projects, nor particular program or agency. The intent of defining Hydrologic Units (HU) for the Watershed Boundary Dataset is to establish a baseline drainage boundary framework, accounting for all land and surface areas. At a minimum, the WBD is being delineated and georeferenced to the USGS 1:24,000 scale topographic base map meeting National Map Accuracy Standards (NMAS). Hydrologic units are given a Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC). For example, a hydrologic region has a 2-digit HUC. A HUC describes where the unit is in the country and the level of the unit. </p>",

Cooling degree days are based on the assumption that when the outside temperature is below 65°F, we don't need cooling (air-conditioning) to be comfortable. Cooling degree-days are the difference between the daily temperature mean and 65°F. For example, if the temperature mean is 85°F, we subtract 65 from the mean and the result is 20 cooling degree-days for that day. (Definition adapted from National Weather Service).</p><p>The two emission scenarios are RCP4.5, a 'medium stabilization scenario' in which emissions are expected to peak in the mid-21st century and decline thereafter, and RCP8.5, a high emissions scenario without any reduction in emissions over time.</p><p> Projected changes are relative to the 1971-2000 mean.

The projections shown in this map layer are adjusted to each station’s mean sea level and converted to the North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD88).</p> <p>The analysis for Massachusetts (DeConto and Kopp, 2017) consisted of a probabilistic assessment of future relative sea level rise at each tide gauge location given two future atmospheric greenhouse gas concentration pathways, medium (RCP4.5) and high (RCP8.5), and for two methods of accounting for Antarctic ice sheet contributions to sea level rise: one based on expert elicitation (Kopp, 2014) and one where Antarctic ice sheet projections are driven by new, process-based numerical ice sheet model simulations (DeConto and Pollard, 2016; Kopp, 2017). A multi-year reference time period for relative sea level was used to minimize biases caused by tidal, seasonal, and inter-annual climate variability, following the accepted practice of using a 19-year tidal datum epoch centered on the year 2000 as the ‘zero’ reference for changes in relative sea level rise. To account for the ‘zero’ reference point utilized for the models and to provide elevations on a common geodetic datum, sea level rise model projection values at each tidal station were adjusted to the station’s mean sea level as computed for the 19 year tidal datum epoch of 1999-2017 and converted to NAVD88.</p> <p>Following the approach in the 2017 National Climate Assessment and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s Global and Regional Sea Level Rise Scenarios for the United States, conditional probability distributions for sea level rise projections can be integrated into different scenarios to support planning and decision-making, given uncertainty and future risks. This approach allows for the many different probabilistic projections (i.e., two models each using two greenhouse gas concentration pathways for multiple time series and several probabilities groups) to be filtered into four scenarios. Under this approach, each of the scenarios—Intermediate, Intermediate-High, High, and Extreme—is cross-walked with two or three probabilistic model outputs (see MetaData URL for definition of scenarios and projections shown in this map layer). </p> <p>On their own, while they are not site-specific projections of mean higher high water levels, these projections provide insight to overall trends in rising sea levels along the Commonwealth coastline, to help coastal municipal officials and workshop participants identify future hazards exacerbated by rising seas.</p> </p>",

ZONEB: represents the land area within one-half mile of the upper boundary of the bank of a Class A surface water source, as defined in 314 CMR 4.05(3)(a), or edge of watershed, whichever is less. Zone B always includes the land area within a 400 ft lateral distance from the upper boundary of the bank of a Class A surface water source. ZONEC: represents the land area not designated as Zone A or B within the watershed of a Class A surface water source, as defined in 314 CMR 4.05(3)(a).  All active and inactive surface water supplies have zones delineated, but some may be covered by other legislation. MassDEP protection Zones A, B, & C are in effect at MWRA sources and are subject to the protections in 310 CMR 22.00. MWRA has additional protections for their reservoirs that are included in the Massachusetts Watershed Protection Act, MGL 350 CMR 11.00. Watershed extents for all surface water supplies including active, inactive, emergency, sources outside of Massachusetts, watersheds that extend into other states and watersheds of sources from other states that extend into Massachusetts are included in the datalayer SWP Watersheds. Surface water intakes on Class B Rivers are not included in either datalayer. The reservoir features were taken from the datalayer and removed from the Zone A and B features and added as a separate feature. For MassDEP's regulatory wording of these zones please see Water Supply Protection Area Definitions..</p>",

Soil survey areas are roughly based on county boundaries. The SSURGO-certified soils dataset is generally the most detailed level of soil geographic data developed by the National Cooperative Soil Survey. The information was prepared by digitizing maps, by compiling information onto a planimetric correct base and digitizing, or by revising digitized maps using remotely sensed and other information. The data include a detailed, field verified inventory of soils and miscellaneous areas that normally occur in a repeatable pattern on the landscape and that can be cartographically shown at the scale mapped. Data for survey areas were developed using various scale base maps: some areas at a 1:25,000 or 1:12,000 scale, or at larger scales where source materials (e.g. 1:5,000 MassGIS ortho imagery) were available. Details for a specific survey area are provided in the NRCS-produced metadata that are distributed with the spatial data.  The soil map units are linked to attributes in the National Soil Information System (NASIS) relational database, which gives the proportionate extent of the component soils and their properties.</p>",

    "description": "<p>The Massachusetts Department of Public Health (MDPH), Center for Environmental Health (CEH), Environmental Toxicology Program (ETP) has developed two marine beach data layers, an arc feature class representing the linear extents of each beach, and points marking beaches' boundaries and access, sampling, and other locations. Data were collected from 7/20/2003 to 10/20/2003 for public and semi-public beaches in Massachusetts' oceanfront communities as part of the BEACH Act, as administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. The beach points (based on GPS) are accurate to within 10 meters.</p>",

    "description": "<p>This data layer is a vector version of the AWS Truewind, LLC, Massachusetts Technology Collaborative 50 meter elevation wind power density raster layer. The raster layer work was jointly funded by the Connecticut Clean Energy Fund, the Massachusetts Technological Collaborative, and Northeast Utilities System.  The raster data were re-classified (AWS_CLASS) in accordance with the 8 classes used by Mass. Tech et al. The data were then converted from raster to polygon using the GRIDPOLY command. The PWRDENSITY field was created to show the power density range (watts/sq. meters) for each class. The data were then transformed from WGS1984 to NAD83 SPC using NAD1983toWGS1984 transform 5 (United States) and clipped to the extent of the WINDSPEEDGRID_POLY layer created by MassGIS and AWS Truewind, LLC. Processing of this polygon layer was completed by the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority (MWRA) GIS program and provided to MassGIS for distribution.</p>",
